# Completions

Configuration snippets and auto completions are suggested based off the syntax and configuration mode.

!!! hint

    Completions are selected by fuzzy matching what you type.

    "**shipintbr**" will match "**show ip interface brief**".

    "**show ip**" will match completions starting with "**ip**"â€“*not* "**show ip**".

    Avoid typing spaces to match more specific completions.

The conversions are activated by typing the mask or opening the completions menu:
