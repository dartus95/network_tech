# Highlighting

Configuration highlighting is context aware.

!!! warning

  There are a huge number of commands so they are not all highlighted.

  The focus is on frequently used commands. This is a **very** subjective statement. If you want extra highlighting added, feel free to open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/heyglen/network_tech/issues)

Supported configurations:

- Cisco ASA

- Cisco ACE

- Cisco IOS

- Cisco IOS XR

- Cisco NXOS


Set the syntax from the command pallet

1. File Menu `Tools` â†’ `Command Pallet`   *or*   :keyboard:`ctrl+shift+p`

2. `Set Syntax: Cisco IOS`   :keyboard:  `<enter>`

File extensions

If a configuration file has a specific file extension and is opened in Sublime Text, the syntax will be automatically be set:


| Syntax       | File Extensions                       |
| :----------- | :-------------------------------------|
| Cisco ASA    | *.cisco-asa, *.asa                    |
| Cisco ACE    | *.cisco-ace                           |
| Cisco IOS    | *.cisco-ios, *.ios                    |
| Cisco IOS-XR | *.cisco-ios-xr, *.ios-xr              |
| Cisco NXOS   | *.cisco-nxos, *.cisco-nexus, *.nxos   |
